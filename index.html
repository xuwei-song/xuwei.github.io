Welcome! My name is Yuwei Wan (万雨薇) and I am a Phd student in Computational Linguistics at City University of Hong Kong. 
Before this, I completed my Computer Science Master degree at Johns Hopkins and my Bachelor in Linguistics and Language Applications, as well as a minor in Computing at CityU. 

<br><br>
My research interests lie in computational linguistics, or so called NLP in computer science, with rich experience in tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation and knowledge representation/acquisition. 
I'd love to explore interdisciplinary NLP task, like NLP in literature, social media, laws, biomedicine and material science.
I also interested in applying linguistics knowledge in NLP models.
Feel free to look at my <a href="https://yuweiwan.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> to learn more!
<br><br>
 <i>NOTE:</i> I'm seeking oppoturnities of co-operation and looking forward to your contact.
