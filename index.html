Welcome! My name is Yuwei Wan (万雨薇) and I am a Master student in Human Language Technology track in Computer Science at John Hopkins. 
Before this, I completed my Bachelor in Linguistics and Language Applications, as well as a minor in Computing at Hong Kong City University. 
I earned a full scholarship and was elected as the student representative of Linguistics and Translation department. My grades ranked 5th in the department when I graduated from CityU.

<br><br>
My research interests lie in computational linguistics. 
Feel free to look at my <a href="https://yuweiwan.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> to learn more!
