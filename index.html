Welcome! My name is Xu Wei (徐微). Now I work as an engineer in AI for Science field, mainly handling with X-ray Adsorption Spectroscopy from 2023.09. Before this, I completed my Master degree IN Computational Catalysis at ShanghaiTech University.  
<br><br>
In the late 2022, Chatgpt renounced the world, which makes me feel thrilled. I didn't choose to continue studing further in 2023 because the first time I think i can do something with AI power.
My interest in AI is not limited to Science applications but also to make <HER> come true.
 <br><br>
Feel free to look at my <a href="https://xuwei.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> to learn more! <br>
<br><br>
 <i>NOTE:</i> I'm seeking oppoturnities of co-operation in law domain (especially HK and mainland law) and looking forward to your contact.
