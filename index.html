Welcome! My name is Yuwei Wan (万雨薇) and I am a Master student in Human Language Technology track in Computer Science at John Hopkins. 
Before this, I completed my Bachelor in Linguistics and Language Applications, as well as a minor in Computing at Hong Kong City University. 

<br><br>
My research interests lie in computational linguistics, especially computational semantics and knowledge representation/acquisition. 
The words mean more than they say. I'd like to explore how to inform machines about the world and let them better understand human.
I also interested in various languages theselves.
Feel free to look at my <a href="https://yuweiwan.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> to learn more!
<br><br>
 <i>NOTE:</i> I'm seeking an oppoturnity of summer research and looking forward to your contact.
