<strong><a href="http://verbnet.lt.cityu.edu.hk/#/">Construction of the Mandarin VerbNet</a></strong>
<br>Supervised by Liu Meichun;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i> Mandarin VerbNet (MV) is meant to provide a lexical semantic database for Mandarin verbs that is linguistically-motivated, 
corpus-based and application-oriented. The database has been used to help various NLP tasks such as Chinese Word Sense Disambiguation (<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-32-9240-6_18">
The Construction and Annotation of a Semantically Enriched Database : The Mandarin VerbNet and Its NLP Applications</a>). 
I worked as a clerical support for this project in my sophomore year. The main responsibilities are collecting sentences, 
summarizing semantic frame of verbs and helping construct VerbNet.</p><br>

<strong>An opinion mining method of Chinese and English e-commercial comments based on dependency parsing and rules</strong>
<br>Patent under application<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i>This invention relates to the technical field of text mining, 
  and discloses a Chinese and English comment opinion mining method combining dependency parsing and rules. 
  The method considers the syntax tree information and the emotional polarity of vocabulary at the same time, 
  summarizes comments in a multi-dimensional manner such as grammar and part of speech, and defines a plurality of opinion extraction rules, 
  so as to effectively identify the opinion-related vocabulary. This method not only reduces the cost of manually labeling data, 
  but also improves the problem of low screening accuracy of candidate opinions to a certain extent. 
  For each opinion and the clause where the opinion is located, the method makes emotional judgment at the level of phrase and single sentence, 
  captures the emotional tendency of consumers in different attribute dimensions of the same commodity, 
  and filters the opinions according to the emotional score to screen out the opinions which have low emotional polarity. 
  The final fine-grained opinions reflect consumers' overall emotional tendency towards the commodity, 
  which can help businesses make decisions in time.</p><br>
