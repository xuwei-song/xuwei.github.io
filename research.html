Different from previous studies from a musicological perspective, this research explores some novel corpus-based methods that attempts to reveal the frequently 
used musical units of the Cantonese Opera in the light of their association with specific semantic categories describable as or attuning to speech acts. 
We firstly mention relationship between classical poetry and classical music in China, aiming to highlight the intrinsic underpinning of semantic expressions across language and music. 
We then move on to a description of the adopted corpus-based methodology and also the corpus of Cantonese Opera specially constructed for the present study. 
Our findings have demonstrated in empirical terms that Cantonese music, like language, has a rich repertoire of meaning expressions through prefabricated musical units 
transparent of their intended functional semantic meanings. Further application: Opera classification and Chinese classic music composition.</p><br>
