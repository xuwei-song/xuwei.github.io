Different from previous studies from a musicological perspective, this research explores some novel corpus-based methods that attempts to reveal the frequently 
used musical units of the Cantonese Opera in the light of their association with specific semantic categories describable as or attuning to speech acts. 
We firstly mention relationship between classical poetry and classical music in China. 
We then move on to a description of the adopted corpus-based methodology and also the corpus of Cantonese Opera specially constructed for the present study. 
In the computation part, we use weka to implement decision tree and naive bayes algorithm to do the classification and feature selection. (the new version is VSM and we may also try segmentation + classification)
Our findings have demonstrated in empirical terms that Cantonese music, like language, has a rich repertoire of meaning expressions through prefabricated musical units 
transparent of their intended functional semantic meanings. Possible further application: Opera classification and Chinese classic music composition & analysis. 
(I was mainly responsible for the computing parts of this research. We are improving the algorithm and seeking the publishment of paper. </p><br>

<br>Supervised by Liu Meichun;<br><br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Abstract: </i> Mandarin VerbNet (MV) is meant to provide a lexical semantic database for Mandarin verbs that is linguistically-motivated, 
corpus-based and application-oriented. The database has been used to help various NLP tasks such as Chinese Word Sense Disambiguation (<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-32-9240-6_18">
The Construction and Annotation of a Semantically Enriched Database : The Mandarin VerbNet and Its NLP Applications</a>). 
I worked as a clerical support for this project in my sophomore year. The main responsibilities are collecting sentences, 
summarizing semantic frame of verbs and helping construct VerbNet.</p><br>
